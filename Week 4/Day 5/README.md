# üß™ [Day 5] CMOS Power Supply & Device Variation Robustness  
> **Sky130 + Ngspice Simulation**

This simulation explores how **supply voltage changes** and **process/device variations** affect CMOS inverter behavior. Ensuring robustness in the presence of these variations is essential for reliable, real-world VLSI design.

## ‚ö° Power Supply Variation

Digital circuits require a stable **V<sub>DD</sub>**, but real systems often experience fluctuations due to:

- IR drop in the power grid
- High switching activity
- External noise/interference
- Voltage droop from shared resources

These variations are critical to evaluate during design.

### üîß Effects of Power Supply Variation

| Variation Type         | Impact                                                            |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lower V<sub>DD</sub>**         | Slower switching, reduced noise margin, risk of logic failure         |
| **Higher V<sub>DD</sub>**        | Faster circuits, but increased dynamic power and potential overstress |
| **Fluctuating V<sub>DD</sub>**   | Unpredictable behavior, possible metastability                        |

### ‚úÖ Why It Matters

Robust circuits must handle supply noise gracefully. Supply variation analysis helps ensure:

- Consistent output transitions
- Preserved noise margins
- Reliable operation across corners

## ‚öñÔ∏è Advantages and Disadvantages of Low Supply Voltage

Using lower supply voltage can reduce power consumption but increases risk of logic failure.

| ‚úÖ Advantages | ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages |
|---------------|------------------|
| Reduces dynamic power | Reduces noise margin |
| Less heat generated | Slows down switching |
| Improves efficiency | Increases sensitivity to variations |

## üèóÔ∏è Device Variation

Even when using the same fabrication process, transistors on a chip are not exactly identical. Small physical differences occur during manufacturing, causing **device variations**.

### üî¨ Sources of Device Variations

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Etching variations | Inaccurate pattern transfer during lithography |
| Oxide thickness variations | Uneven gate oxide affects transistor behavior |
| Channel doping variations | Changes in impurity concentration affect switching |
| Line edge roughness | Irregular transistor dimensions |

These variations change transistor behavior from its design intent, affecting circuit performance.

## üß™ Simulation of Device Variations

Smart SPICE simulations help observe inverter behavior under **process variations**. Random variations are applied to transistor dimensions and material properties to evaluate robustness. This ensures the design works even in worst-case silicon fabrication scenarios.
