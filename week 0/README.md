cd /media/$USER/VBox_GAs_*/
./autorun.sh
```

### 🛠️ Yosys – Installation Guide

**Yosys** serves as a fundamental synthesis tool for transforming Verilog RTL into a gate-level netlist. It’s a core requirement for progressing through the RISC-V SoC workflow.

Below is a step-by-step method to install Yosys from source on Ubuntu-based systems:



#### 📥 Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
sudo apt-get update
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys
sudo apt install make
sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
make config-gcc
git submodule update --init --recursive
makem
sudo make install
```
### 🛠️ Yosys Installation Process (Quick Overview)

- Begin by downloading the Yosys source files using the `git clone` command.
- Next, install all necessary libraries and tools (like `clang`, `bison`, `flex`, etc.) required to compile Yosys.
- After setting up the environment, compile the project with `make`, and complete the setup by running `sudo make install`.
- Make sure to initialize all git submodules (especially `abc`) using `git submodule update --init --recursive`, as they're crucial for the build to succeed.

### 🧰 Iverilog – Verilog Simulation Tool

**Iverilog** is a command-line simulator used for verifying digital designs described in Verilog. It's essential for testing and validating your logic before synthesis or physical design.

To set it up on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iverilog
```
### 🟢 This command installs Iverilog from the official Ubuntu package repository, making the setup fast and hassle-free.

### 🔍 Use Iverilog to compile and simulate Verilog source files. It's an integral part of early-stage verification in the RISC-V SoC workflow.

### 📉 Installing GTKWave – Waveform Visualization Tool

### GTKWave is a popular application used to graphically view waveforms generated by hardware simulations. It provides an intuitive interface to analyze signal behavior over time.

## To install GTKWave on Ubuntu, simply run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gtkwave
```
### This command retrieves GTKWave from Ubuntu’s default package repository and installs it effortlessly.

### 💡 GTKWave is typically used alongside simulators like Icarus Verilog to open .vcd files and visually inspect simulation outputs, aiding in debugging and validation.

# 📘 Week 0: Environment Setup for Open-Source VLSI Design

This week focuses on setting up a complete open-source EDA environment for ASIC design. We’ll install all required tools like `ngspice`, `magic`, `docker`, and `OpenLane` to begin working on RTL-to-GDSII flows.

---

## 🧪 ngspice – Circuit Simulation Tool

`ngspice` is a powerful mixed-signal simulator used for validating analog and digital circuit designs.

📥 **Download** from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/

```bash
tar -zxvf ngspice-37.tar.gz
cd ngspice-37
mkdir release && cd release
../configure --with-x --with-readline=yes --disable-debug
make
sudo make install
```

✅ *To verify*, run:
```bash
ngspice
```

You should see the ngspice terminal interface.

## 🧱 Magic – VLSI Layout Editor

`magic` is used for physical layout design and DRC (Design Rule Check).

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install m4 tcsh csh libx11-dev tcl-dev tk-dev \
libcairo2-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libncurses-dev

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip make git

sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor \
-o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

## 🚀 OpenLane – RTL to GDSII Flow

OpenLane is a digital ASIC design flow tool that automates synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and GDSII generation.

### Clone & Build:
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane
