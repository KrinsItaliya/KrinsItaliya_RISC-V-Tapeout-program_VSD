## 🖥️ Enabling Full VM Display (For VirtualBox Users)

If using VirtualBox, improve your VM’s usability by enabling full-screen resolution:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
cd /media/$USER/VBox_GAs_*/
./autorun.sh
```

### 🛠️ Yosys – Installation Guide

**Yosys** serves as a fundamental synthesis tool for transforming Verilog RTL into a gate-level netlist. It’s a core requirement for progressing through the RISC-V SoC workflow.

Below is a step-by-step method to install Yosys from source on Ubuntu-based systems:



#### 📥 Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
sudo apt-get update
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
cd yosys
sudo apt install make
sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
make config-gcc
git submodule update --init --recursive
makem
sudo make install
```
### 🛠️ Yosys Installation Process (Quick Overview)

- Begin by downloading the Yosys source files using the `git clone` command.
- Next, install all necessary libraries and tools (like `clang`, `bison`, `flex`, etc.) required to compile Yosys.
- After setting up the environment, compile the project with `make`, and complete the setup by running `sudo make install`.
- Make sure to initialize all git submodules (especially `abc`) using `git submodule update --init --recursive`, as they're crucial for the build to succeed.

### 🧰 Iverilog – Verilog Simulation Tool

**Iverilog** is a command-line simulator used for verifying digital designs described in Verilog. It's essential for testing and validating your logic before synthesis or physical design.

To set it up on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iverilog
```
### 🟢 This command installs Iverilog from the official Ubuntu package repository, making the setup fast and hassle-free.

### 🔍 Use Iverilog to compile and simulate Verilog source files. It's an integral part of early-stage verification in the RISC-V SoC workflow.

### 📉 Installing GTKWave – Waveform Visualization Tool

### GTKWave is a popular application used to graphically view waveforms generated by hardware simulations. It provides an intuitive interface to analyze signal behavior over time.

## To install GTKWave on Ubuntu, simply run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gtkwave
```
### This command retrieves GTKWave from Ubuntu’s default package repository and installs it effortlessly.

### 💡 GTKWave is typically used alongside simulators like Icarus Verilog to open .vcd files and visually inspect simulation outputs, aiding in debugging and validation.
